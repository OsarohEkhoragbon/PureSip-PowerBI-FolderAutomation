# 🥤 PureSip Beverages – Power BI Folder Automation Case Study

## 📄 Project Summary

This case study focuses on automating sales data consolidation and performance analysis for **PureSip Beverages**, a company that distributes popular beverage brands like **Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Dasani, and Powerade** to major retail chains such as **Walmart, Walgreens, Target, and Costco**.

PureSip faced challenges due to its manual, spreadsheet-based reporting system managed by regional managers. The inconsistency and decentralization made it difficult to generate accurate, real-time insights for strategic decision-making.

By implementing **Power BI with a local folder connection**, the company streamlined data ingestion, improved reporting accuracy, and enabled automated dashboard updates for near-instant visibility into sales performance.
